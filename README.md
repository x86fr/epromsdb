**Current version: 1.00 - 2024/09/09**

Here you can find an open-source copy of the database behind epromsdb.com in JSON, XML and SQL format.

If you're looking for the RAW file collection, please download it using the .torrent file located in the ```.files``` directory.

Hopefully, this will help keep older computers running and contribute to the digital preservation of vintage hardware!
